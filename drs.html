            <h3>Tai Phake tribe in Namphake village, Assam</h3>
   			<p>Tai Phake is a very obscure tribe from Assam with a handful population of around 2000 globally. They have a glorious culture and tradition. Being very small in number, the tribe is trying hard to keep their legacy and rich culture alive. They reside in small villages in Dibrugarh district with a major population staying in Namphake village in Dibrugarh. The village has 100 percent literacy and there hasn't been a single police complaint filed in the village till date. This is one of the interesting facts we came across from our secondary research of the place. Tai Phakes is keeping alive their glorious tradition by still living in their traditional houses, dressing in their traditional attire and also by the food they eat every day.<br><br>
            These insights from all the secondary research developed the curiosity among us to know more about the tribe. The project aimed to explore the history, culture, tradition and current status of Tai Phakes. The project gave us an opportunity to observe closely and live the life of Tai Phakes. All the information gathered by interviews, looking at artefacts, observations and insights are described in the report.
